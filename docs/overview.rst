    Note:

    The top-level README.rst file is meant as a fallback for things like GitHub hosting, and is not meant to
    be what one might upload to PyPI.

    If this project was every released to PyPI, then either the sphinx docs would get published to ReadTheDocs (and
    the URL to that hosting included in the README.rst), or the sphinx docs' HTML build would be uploaded to PyPI
    in lieu of the README.rst.
